DataMentor – AI-Driven Supervised Machine Learning Platform
Project Overview

DataMentor is an intelligent, end-to-end supervised machine learning guidance platform designed to help beginners and analysts understand data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and results in a structured and explainable way.

The platform automates key data science steps and explains why each step is performed, making it suitable for users with limited ML background as well as for educational use.

Key Features

Automated data profiling (missing values, distributions, correlations)

Intelligent preprocessing recommendations (imputation, outlier handling)

Supervised ML model selection for classification and regression problems

Business-aligned evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, RMSE, etc.)

LLM-powered assistant to explain preprocessing logic and model outcomes in simple language

Beginner-friendly UI with clear workflow guidance

Core Technologies

Backend: Python, Flask

ML: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (Supervised Learning)

LLM Integration: API-based LLM for explanations and guidance

Frontend: Jinja2 Templates, HTML, CSS

Utilities: UUID, modular service architecture

Repository Structure (Current Upload)

Due to system and Git push limitations while working with a large project directory, the repository currently contains the core functional components required to understand the system architecture and logic:

main.py – Application entry point

services/ – Core ML pipeline, preprocessing, and LLM integration logic

templates/ – Frontend UI templates

Supporting configuration and Git-related files

Important Note:
The complete project folder (including full datasets, logs, and some local environment artifacts) could not be pushed to GitHub due to size and transfer constraints. The uploaded files represent the actual working logic and structure of the project.
